##commonroad-telluride2020
This is the version of commonroad-vehicle-models that we used in 2020. To speed up the car models, we cythonized the code. 
This folder has been replaced by commonroad-vehicle-models git submodule,  such that we can always have the latest version. Check out the project here:
